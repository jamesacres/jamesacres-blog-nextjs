I documented my journey replacing Google Home with Home Assistant. It was more complex than anticipated, but totally worth the effort, hopefully these steps will help others and my future self.

Over Christmas all my smart home with Google Home and Google Assitant randomly changed voice and was increasingly spinning and becoming unresponsive. Basic things like playing the radio and casting became almost impossible. I have given up with this failing and unsupported platform while it moves to Gemini.

[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is very impressive, and all open source, [Music Assistant](https://www.music-assistant.io/) too. It has worked flawlessly over the past 5 months and I've had no problems with any updates going wrong so far, but I have backups turned on just in case.

A big benefit of the new setup is it is all local (except for cloud for better voice performance). For example I've moved all smart sockets to use MQTT rather than Meross cloud as part of this change so they are now instant.

# Automations

I have configured voice control, but rather than relying on voice, I have automated common tasks in other ways not previously possible:
* Zigbee devices to control lights when opening doors / pressing button
* Zigbee cube which plays different music each side of a cube, and shake to move music between rooms
* Mobile devices all leave home / are at home cause routines to start / end
* Sunset/Sunrise to turn garden lights and motion sensitive lights on and off
* Keep lights on until music amp turns off in living room, else turn off at 11pm
* Time morning lamp and start playing BBC Radio 6 Music

# Setup steps

Quite a few steps required, and some advanced tweaks will be documented below.

Plugged in Home Assistant Green, and waited until yellow light flashed like a heartbeat consistently.

Downloaded and installed [Home Assistant App](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mobile_app/) for Android. Automatically detected IP address once on heartbeat.
I created a secure user account saved to my KeePass.
I allowed background location access and notifications to give full access.
It automatically discovered our Cambridge Audio Evo 150 and Cast devices. I configured everything it found except for the upnp router which didn't work and I had no need for.

Going to the overview screen now showed what was already playing on Evo 150 and it was impressive how it was fully integrated with the cambridge settings already.
![](/content/images/2025/home-assistant/phone1.png)

I found I could access home assistant on my laptop from https://my.home-assistant.io/ when visiting I configured it to redirect to http://homeassistant.local:8123 which was the default and I can login from there.

![](/content/images/2025/home-assistant/pc1.png)
![](/content/images/2025/home-assistant/pc2.png)

Next I wanted to setup [Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)](https://hacs.xyz/) as I know a lot of things I want to setup need this first.


This involved a few steps.

In the HACS [prerequisites](https://hacs.xyz/docs/use/download/prerequisites/) they listed being able to edit files.
So, I went to the settings addons store and installed studio code server.
I want minimal things running for efficiency so I then disabled it from starting at boot, and made it show in the sidebar.
I then started it and went to the sidebar. I chose Solarised Dark as my colour scheme.

![](/content/images/2025/home-assistant/pc3.png)

Next I used an addon to install HACS via https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=cb646a50_get&repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhacs%2Faddons

![](/content/images/2025/home-assistant/pc4.png)

As instructed after install from the logs I restarted home assistant from the top right ... menu.

![](/content/images/2025/home-assistant/pc5.png)

I then proceeded to follow the instructions from https://hacs.xyz/docs/use/configuration/basic/#to-set-up-the-hacs-integration
Hard refreshed, then went to devices & services, then pressed Add Integration button bottom right.
I then searched for HACS and selected it. It them prompted me to Authorise github which I completed.

![](/content/images/2025/home-assistant/pc6.png)

Next I configured a backup process as recommended. I went to settings > system > backups, then saved the emergency kit and encryption key to my KeePass.
I chose to backup everything as I don't believe I will have large media files to skip.
I then downloaded the first backup to my laptop, just in case.

When going to the Map menu item I noticed it was showing my home in a different location to my phone. I went to settings > system > general and edited the location of the home.

## Meross MQTT Local Setup

I already owned [Meross](https://www.meross.com/) devices like smart extension leads and smart sockets.

I wanted to setup my Meross devices. I've been using them via the Meross Cloud with Google Home, but now would like to make my setup fully local if I can.

I installed the default MQTT (Mosquitto broker) addon via home assistant addons.
It automatically discovered it so I added it as it recommended.

![](/content/images/2025/home-assistant/pc7.png)

I based the setup on the instructions at https://github.com/krahabb/meross_lan/discussions/63#discussioncomment-7452413
and https://github.com/bytespider/Meross/wiki/Home-Assistant-(HASSIO)

I created a new directory for the following node project which I will use to convert each Meross device to local.

Create and edit package.json below.

Change `192.168.0.84` to the IP address of your homeassistant.local and make sure it is set to a static IP on your router so it does not change (you can't use the hostname, sadly).

Change ssid to the WIFI you want the device to connect to (i.e. the garden WiFi if closest to that router) and change pass to the Wifi Password.

```
{
  "engines": {
    "node": "^18"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "commander": "^13.0.0",
    "meross": "^1.0.15",
    "uuid": "^11.0.3"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "info": "meross info -g 10.10.10.1",
    "setup": "meross setup --gateway 10.10.10.1 --wifi-ssid Xxx-Xxx --wifi-pass xxxxx --mqtt mqtts://192.168.0.84:8883"
  }
}
```

Next connected the mac wifi to the Meross device which was flashing orange and green (hold plug power for 5 seconds to reset).

![](/content/images/2025/home-assistant/pc8.png)

Then running `npm run info` made a note of the mac address and password. I then switched back to the normal wifi.

In Home Assistant, go to Configuration > People and add a new user. Customise the Display Name and use the device Mac address as the username, and the password from the previous step.

![](/content/images/2025/home-assistant/pc9.png)

I then switched back to the Meross WiFi and ran `npm run setup`.

At this point I realised it didn't connect because I didn't configured the SSL certificates on the MQTT.
I used the terminal in studio code in home assistant to create the directories /ssl/mqtt and /share/mosquitto

I then edited the Mosquitto broker configuration to change it to active and updated the paths
Certificate file mqtt/server.crt
CA File (under optional toggle) mqtt/ca.crt
Private key file mqtt/server.key

![](/content/images/2025/home-assistant/pc10.png)

I notice the commands below have 360 days, therefore I suspect a new certificate will need to be updated before next year.
Although, apparently Meross doesn't check the certificate https://albertogeniola.github.io/MerossIot/meross-protocol.html#client-device-pairing

To create the CA keys:

```

Enter pass phrase for ca.key:
```

Next I added the /share and /ssl folders to studio code and dragged and dropped the certificates into mqtt.

Next, using studio code, inside the share/mosquitto directory create two files accesscontrollist and acl.conf.
accesscontrollist:
```
topic readwrite #
pattern readwrite #
```

acl.conf:
```
acl_file /share/mosquitto/accesscontrollist
```

It will end up looking something like this:

![](/content/images/2025/home-assistant/pc11.png)


Next, restart Mosquitto Broker and you should see it stable. As active is true it reads the files we have just created.
You should also see Certificates found: SSL is available.

If you do `curl homeassistant.local:8883`
curl: (52) Empty reply from server

This shows in the logs like
```
2025-01-04 17:27:23: New connection from 172.30.32.1:45474 on port 8883.
2025-01-04 17:27:23: OpenSSL Error[0]: error:1408F09C:SSL routines:ssl3_get_record:http request
2025-01-04 17:27:23: Client <unknown> disconnected: Protocol error.
```

Next, turn on Meross device!
Hmm, nothing shows in the logs.
Looking at the router, it has successfully connected to the wifi. We can ping it at 192.168.0.150

Right, so the Meross device doesn't like the MQTT broker being the hostname homeassistant.local:8883 so I've changed this to 192.168.0.84:8883
I can now see it connected successfully. Make sure you set the right values in package.json.

We don't want these IP addresses to change. In the router settings I've made that first meross device static, and the home assistant static. Static DHCPv4 - Local Network

![](/content/images/2025/home-assistant/pc12.png)

Next. When going to settings I see an Operating System update, I choose to install it. Probably should have done that first.
Then I created another backup.

Let's continue with the Meross Setup..
I went to HACS in the side menu then searched for Meross LAN as instructed by https://github.com/krahabb/meross_lan
It then prompted me to restart in the settings so I went there and did it.

![](/content/images/2025/home-assistant/pc13.png)

I then got a notification saying it had identified my Meross devices.

![](/content/images/2025/home-assistant/pc14.png)

This included the ones I hadn't converted to MQTT yet.. some are still on the Cloud Setup and using Google Home.
In brackets it shows the MAC address. So I chose the one which matched the one we just configured.

![](/content/images/2025/home-assistant/pc15.png)

I then renamed it to Lamp and tested turning it on and off, it works!

![](/content/images/2025/home-assistant/pc16.png)

I have two extension leads and another plug to move to the new system. Now the hard stuff is done all I need to do is put them into paiting mode, run the info command, add the user with mac address and password as a home assistant user, then run my setup command to configure MQTT, then add it via Home Assistant.
I went in the garden in the snow to connect to the garden extension. The button on the device didn't work so had to remove from the Meross app to reset it! Also forgot to change the setup script from the main wifi to the garden but got there eventually!

Then another backup!

## Voice Assistant Setup

Adding voice assistant
I followed this tutorial https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/voice_remote_local_assistant
I installed Whisper, Piper and openWakeWord.
I connected the Atom Echo via the link on this page https://www.home-assistant.io/voice_control/thirteen-usd-voice-remote/. You connect via USBC to your computer then select the port and configure the WIFI password.

I then wanted it to come out my existing Google Home speakers next to it.
I followed the guide at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3yZWD_sFIE&ab_channel=SmartHomeJunkie with some tweaks.

First I had to install ESPHome Device Builder addon.
Then I installed the one associated with the kitchen.
Press edit then paste code from https://github.com/esphome/firmware/blob/main/voice-assistant/m5stack-atom-echo.yaml
Didn't work, due to https://github.com/esphome/firmware/issues/286

media_player.kitchen_speaker media_player.bedroom_speaker

```
on_tts_start:
  - speaker.volume_set: 0%
on_tts_end:
  - homeassistant.service:
      service: media_player.play_media
      data:
        entity_id: media_player.kitchen_speaker
        media_content_id: !lambda 'return x;'
        media_content_type: music
        announce: "true"
```

I got an error so also adjusted
```
esp32:
  board: m5stack-atom
  framework:
    type: esp-idf
    version: 4.4.8
    platform_version: 5.4.0
```


I used this to add RoboVac https://github.com/CodeFoodPixels/robovac


The speech to text wasn't good enough. So I subscribed to nabu casa. It fixed the issue and now understands I am saying turn on the garden lights rather than things like turn on the cardin shown in the debug view.
It also includes remote access, and making devices show in Google Assistant if I want them to.

## Govee Lamp Setup

I the used Govee integration in HACS as my light didn't support local LAN. I had to request an API key in the about section of the Govee app and input it into Home Assistant.
This integration in HACS did not work. When removing it I also had a leftover govee.state which I could not remove. I found I had to go to developer tools > actions then purge entities and select it, then restart home assistant.
Instead I followed https://github.com/wez/govee2mqtt/blob/main/docs/ADDON.md I added it as an addon repository and installed it. Then configured API key, username and password. The office light then showed up.

## Automations Setup

I setup some automations, sunset to turn on the garden and living room lights and motion sensor ones.
And sunrise to turn off the motion sensor lights.

## Music Assistant Setup

Music Assistant, radio browser bbc, qobuz

BBC Radio 6 music and BBC Radio 1 I used these URLs. International access is being removed so these links may change.

Morning routine salt lamp and radio.

Need to add weather later, seems more tricky to read it out, perhaps notifications to phone will do later?




Atom echo improvements
Using https://github.com/esphome/firmware/blob/main/voice-assistant/m5stack-atom-echo.adopted.yaml





Next plans:
Try to improve wake word detection
Make sound come out of speakers instead of echo
Voice support for music assistant
SLZB-06M Zigbee controller
Aqara Door and Window Sensor T1 (back door (garden lights on/off, alarm), later front door (alarm), later bedroom door (salt lamp, alarm)) https://www.aqara-shop.co.uk/product/aqara-door-and-window-sensor-t1-trio-bundle/
Aqara Cube T1 Pro (shake: transfer queue to living room, 1: music off, 2: play 6 music 3: play radio 1, 4: play greatest hits radio, 5: 5 min timer, 6: shuffle favourites ) https://www.aqara-shop.co.uk/product/aqara-cube-t1-pro/
Aqara Wireless Mini Switch T1 (bedroom toggle: salt lamp, long press: turn off all lights, double press: turn off music) https://www.aqara-shop.co.uk/product/aqara-wireless-mini-switch-t1/
later Vibration sensor (on door to turn on salt lamp) https://www.aqara-shop.co.uk/product/aqara-vibration-sensor/
Bin day notification







I then remembered I want zigbee on channel 25. I edited it, this then seemed to disconnect everything, via the web interface I told it SLZB-06 to reboot.
I couldn't get this to work so restored my old settings. Apparently repairing can be difficult so once you have a channel you have to stick with it.


Choose Zigbee Channel 25 - as our wifi is channel 1


Zigbee Channel Recommendations:
Zigbee channels are numbered 11 to 26, corresponding to different frequencies within the 2.4 GHz band. The most commonly used channels are:

Zigbee Channel 15: This is a good middle ground, avoiding overlap with the most common WiFi channels.

Zigbee Channel 20: Another good choice, slightly higher in the spectrum but still away from most WiFi channels.

Zigbee Channel 25: This is at the upper end of the Zigbee channel range and can avoid most WiFi interference, but some Zigbee devices might not support it.

WiFi Channel Recommendations:
For your WiFi, especially on the 2.4 GHz band, you should ideally choose one of the non-overlapping channels:

WiFi Channel 1: Best if you're using Zigbee Channel 25.

WiFi Channel 6: Best if you're using Zigbee Channel 15.

WiFi Channel 11: Best if you're using Zigbee Channel 15 or 20.

Suggested Setup:
Zigbee Controller: Set to Channel 15 or 20.

WiFi Access Point: Set to Channel 1 or 11.

this worked and fine for living room as we don't want to change other settings

for kitchen and bedroom we want to announce to the speaker itself

next replace with code from
https://github.com/esphome/firmware/blob/main/voice-assistant/m5stack-atom-echo.adopted.yaml
but keep api and wifi parts
we will also keep the name and friendly_name the same as we have multiple of them
```
  name: m5stack-atom-echo-a16370
  friendly_name: M5Stack Atom Echo a16370
```
and we will also add
```
esp32:
  board: m5stack-atom
  framework:
    type: esp-idf
    version: 4.4.8
    platform_version: 5.4.0
```

and edit in (keep existing and patch the extra bits):
```
on_tts_start:
  - speaker.volume_set: 0%
on_tts_end:
  - homeassistant.service:
      service: media_player.play_media

        media_content_id: !lambda 'return x;'
        media_content_type: music
        announce: "true"
```

Problem! music does not resume after!!!
trying to look into music assistant's solutions to this
https://www.music-assistant.io/integration/announcements/?h=announce
https://www.music-assistant.io/faq/massannounce/
I think it might be because I am sending it to the original device rather than the music assistant entity.
Going to try changing it to _2
That worked!!!!
Music assistant also has a setting for announcements on each player. I turned off pre announce on each to get rid of the ding noise, unfortunately not possible to remove the one from google cast.

We also want this audio when timers end, like Alexa set a timer for 10 seconds.

Edit on_timer_finished
Changed to
```
  on_timer_finished:
    - switch.turn_on: timer_ringing
    - light.turn_on:
        id: led
        red: 0%
        green: 100%
        blue: 0%
        brightness: 100%
        effect: "Fast Pulse"
    - homeassistant.service:
        service: tts.cloud_say
        data:
          entity_id: media_player.kitchen_speaker_2
          message: "The timer has finished"
    - delay: 1s
    - script.execute: reset_led
    - switch.turn_off: timer_ringing
```

After installing, I had to go to settings, the devices and service, ESPHome, Then press configure next to each microphone and tick the box to allow it to run home assistant actions. This allows the atom echo to play media to the speaker!

Adding music assistant voice controls
Following instructions at https://www.music-assistant.io/integration/voice/?h=voice
Did not work, as it's not installed with HACS, no support for now!
Going to get a cube to control it instead, and use phone!


Created a custom dashboard


------

## Stop saying sorry

Stop announcing sorry message! Instead ignore and don't send to speaker
How do we do this?
Well, esphome says we can have lambda conditions, which is C++.

https://esphome.io/automations/actions.html#lambda-condition
lambda Condition
This condition performs an arbitrary piece of C++ code (see Lambda) and can be used to create conditional flow in actions.


We know already we're doing !lambda 'return x;'
According to this page https://community.home-assistant.io/t/retrieving-text-output-from-esphome-voice-assistant/609668/8
on_tts_start x is the text
on_tts_end x is the raw file for the response
So, to make it available to us in on_tts_end we could set it to a global variable in the start block so it is available in the end lambda https://esphome.io/components/globals.html

put this above voice_assistant
```
globals:
  - id: tts_global_string
    type: std::string
```

put this to the bottom of
```
on_tts_start:
  - lambda: id(tts_global_string) = x;
```

Then, we can check if the text does not start with sorry
So, how about we check to see if x starts with Sorry. As all the error intents start with Sorry https://github.com/home-assistant/intents/blob/b383112204efc86886ebf26e71112469cf8a7625/sentences/en/_common.yaml#L5
```
    - if:
        condition:
          lambda: return id(tts_global_string).rfind("Sorry", 0) == -1;
        then:
          - homeassistant.service:
              service: media_player.play_media
              data:
                entity_id: media_player.kitchen_speaker_2
                media_content_id: !lambda 'return x;'
                media_content_type: music
                announce: "true"
        else:
          - light.turn_on:
              id: led
              red: 100%
              green: 0%
              blue: 0%
              brightness: 100%
              effect: none
          - delay: 1s
          - script.execute: reset_led
```

## Performance Monitoring

I wanted to check why CPU at 50%
I Installed Glances https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-glances/blob/b901132e4a32b08d1c5d91d8779ad1e3aae0cb1e/glances/DOCS.md
addon_core_openwakeword had highest CPU, presumably from the microphone listening to our music I wonder if there is a way to pause listening with music.
Even when pausing music it was still the same. So presumably it is always streaming and no difference when it's silent.
I guess only way would be to change Atom Echo to stop streaming and start again when nearby somehow.

Turning off the living room one went from 50% to 30% for the two in Kitchen and Bedroom.

## Zigbee Setup

Setting up SMLIGHT SLZB-06M over USB in Home Assistant Green
Plug in USB cable
Press small button on the device, took a couple of attempts for it to light up the blue LED which is USB mode.

I added https://github.com/zigbee2mqtt/hassio-zigbee2mqtt addon repository
In the addon store I then searched for zigbee and selected Zigbee2MQTT
Then pressed install.
Changing enabled to true in the config, and press start
Code Server in terminal run ha hardware info
I then see in the logs.
Error: USB adapter discovery error (No valid USB adapter found). Specify valid 'adapter' and 'port' in your configuration.
I tried to work out what the USB tty by-id was but couldn't find it!
I gave up and plugged in an ethernet cable.
At this point I can actually navigate to slzb-06m.local in the browser!
At this point, Home Assistant also found discovered devices.
I decided to remove Zigbee2MQTT and go with the default ZHA (Zigbee Home Automation) setup
I also added the SMLIGHT SLZB integration which apparently offers some of the stuff from the web interface.
This then prompted me to update the firmware which I did.
Installed version
v2.3.6.plus
Latest version
v2.7.0

I pressed add new device which opened Zigbee pairing.
I took the cover off my cube, pressed the button until the blue LED blinked.
It appeared quickly and allowed me to set it up.
I went to https://community.home-assistant.io/t/zha-xiaomi-cube-controller/495975
and followed the instructions to add a numeric helper input.
I imported the blueprint, then set the numeric helper and selected my cube.
https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/blueprint_import/?blueprint_url=https://github.com/SirGoodenough/HA_Blueprints/blob/master/Automations/ZHA-Xiaomi_Cube_Controller.yaml
I renamed it to Kitchen Cube, it then appeared in my automations section.
I tested shake, it worked! The living room lights toggled on and off!
The other automations didn't work, I added Kitchen Cube Last to my dashboard and realised it was on 0. Also searching for zha_event only came up with shake. Opening cube and pressing the button 5 times quickly changed the mode and then it worked and updated when changing side.

I used Double Tap with face x actions.
(shake: transfer queue to living room, 1: music off, 2: play 6 music 3: play radio 1, 4: play greatest hits radio, 5: pitchfork best new music, 6: shuffle favourites )


Clicking allows me to edit:


I changed the automation for the cube to only process shake.
Then added new automations manually to react when the side of the cube changes.
This way it only starts playing music when it actually changes.


## Text to Speech Announcements

Create script to make an announcement
https://community.home-assistant.io/t/how-would-you-setup-an-audio-announcement-system-with-ha/804011/2
```

```


I made it announce the weather forecast and temperature! And say Good morning and day of week. I copied this into the morning automation.
```
action: script.make_an_announcement
metadata: {}
data:
  speakers: bedroom_speaker_2
  announcement: Good Morning! Happy {{ now().strftime('%A') }}!
```
```
action: weather.get_forecasts

  entity_id: weather.forecast_home
```
```
action: script.make_an_announcement
metadata: {}
data:
  speakers: bedroom_speaker_2
  announcement: >-
    Today it will be {{ daily['weather.forecast_home'].forecast[0].condition }}.
    The temperature will be 
    {{daily['weather.forecast_home'].forecast[0].temperature}}.
```

## Phone Announcements
If we want to notify phone we can use the following:
