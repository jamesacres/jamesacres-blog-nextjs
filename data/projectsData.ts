    title: 'Bubbly Clouds',
    description: `Bubbly Clouds is James Acres' sole trader business identity. It is the parent brand of upcoming projects. Between October 2013 and September 2021 it operated as a web hosting, SSL and domains business. This business stopped operating due to rising costs from cPanel and WHMCS partners and a decline in clients following the 2020 pandemic. I provided various local businesses across the South of England with PHP, Node.js, Python, Perl and more with the industry leading cPanel and WHM all of which I managed at Linode. I provided personal technical support across a wide range of web, email, networking and sysadmin issues, plus of course the usual business as usual.`,
